- Pre Public Blockchain Operations
   - The development of STASH and other concepts will take time, and it is hard to solidify a final solution for the blockchain. It is important, therefore, to operate initially on a private blockchain, which we call Ahket Private Chain.
   - Ahket Private Chain (APC)
      - Will be a single node.
      - EVM-based, so programming is in Solidity for the smart contracts.
      - Provides traceability and transparency, which will be trusted as much as the trust in Ahket Inc.
   
- Ahket Registries
   - Ahket will create its own Registries.

- Verification Funds
   - A Verification Fund would prepay for verification. In this case, according to some rules based on the verifiers and the attestations, the Verification Fund can create a Verification Ticket for a verifier. This ticket will be paid by the fund.
   - Applications for such funds include:
      - Provide promotional discount to verify attestations at low, or no, cost.
      - Provide a free number of verifications for users.
      - Help some verifiers create some shared fund for their verifications.
   - VAO will be able to create some Verification Funds.

- Ahket Strategy
   - Ahket operation is planned to evolve through phases. Insights and experiences from a phase will determine the timing of transition to the subsequent one, allowing for adaptive evolution.
      - Phase 1, Current Phase
         - A VAO Stage A.
         - WEB2, only.
         - It is possible in this phase that Ahket Inc help some bulk issuers, such as a major university, to build and manage their own Registration for the attestations. Those Registries will be admitted by Ahket into STASH.
            - This will increase the revenue of the bulk issuers as owner and holder of their own attestations.
            - This will require a special webapp (WEB2) for the bulk issuers to manage and supervise their Regitries.
      - Phase 2:
         - In this phase, users will have a direct access to STASH.
         - Other WEB2 and DAPPS will be developed on top of STASH.
         - It is a WEB3 phase, while VAO and WEB2 access is still active.
      - Phase 3:
         - Is the the same as Phase 2, but now others can create and own Registries in STASH.

   - Transition to Phase 2 will happen after some period of time---not determined as of Jan 1, 2024. The decision to transition is Ahket Inc's and will depend on:
      - Reaching healthy number of use of VAO, and the number of users that are actively using it.
      - The appetite of the market for WEB3 solutions. Such in the case that the crypto market is growing with more adoption.
   - Transition to Phase 3 will be decided after confirming the stability of Phase 2 for some period of time with healthy growth in the number of active users.


The equation for a geometric series can be expressed in a couple of key ways, depending on whether you're dealing with a finite or infinite geometric series.

1. **Finite Geometric Series**: The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}
   \]
   where:
   - \( a \) is the first term of the series,
   - \( r \) is the common ratio between consecutive terms, and
   - \( n \) is the number of terms.

2. **Infinite Geometric Series**: If a geometric series has an infinite number of terms and the absolute value of the common ratio \( r \) is less than 1 (\(|r| < 1\)), then the sum \( S \) of the series converges to:
   \[
   S = \frac{a}{1 - r}
   \]
   This formula applies only when the series is convergent, meaning \( |r| < 1 \).

These formulas provide a compact way to sum geometric series, which are a fundamental concept in algebra and calculus, with applications in various areas of mathematics and science.
