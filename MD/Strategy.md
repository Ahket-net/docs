## Pre Public Blockchain Operations

- The development of STASH and other concepts will take time, and it is hard to solidify a final solution for the blockchain. It is important, therefore, to operate initially on a private blockchain, which we call Ahket Private Chain.

- Ahket Private Chain (APC)
   - Will be a single node.
   - EVM-based, so programming is in Solidity for the smart contracts.
   - Provides traceability and transparency, which will be trusted as much as the trust in Ahket Inc.
   
- Ahket Registries
   - Ahket will create its own Registries.

- Verification Funds
- 
   - A Verification Fund would prepay for verification. In this case, according to some rules based on the verifiers and the attestations, the Verification Fund can create a Verification Ticket for a verifier. This ticket will be paid by the fund.
   
   - Applications for such funds include:
      - Provide promotional discount to verify attestations at low, or no, cost.
      - Provide a free number of verifications for users.
      - Help some verifiers create some shared fund for their verifications.
   
   - VAO will be able to create some Verification Funds.

## Ahket Strategy

   - Ahket operation is planned to evolve through phases. Insights and experiences from a phase will determine the timing of transition to the subsequent one, allowing for adaptive evolution.
      
      - Phase 1, Current Phase
         - A VAO Stage A.
         - WEB2, only.
         - It is possible in this phase that Ahket Inc help some bulk issuers, such as a major university, to build and manage their own Registration for the attestations. Those Registries will be admitted by Ahket into STASH.
            
            - This will increase the revenue of the bulk issuers as owner and holder of their own attestations.
            
            - This will require a special webapp (WEB2) for the bulk issuers to manage and supervise their Regitries.
      
      - Phase 2:
         - In this phase, users will have a direct access to STASH.
         - Other WEB2 and DAPPS will be developed on top of STASH.
         - It is a WEB3 phase, while VAO and WEB2 access is still active.
      
      - Phase 3:
         - Is the the same as Phase 2, but now others can create and own Registries in STASH.

   - Transition to Phase 2 will happen after some period of time---not determined as of Jan 1, 2024. The decision to transition is Ahket Inc's and will depend on:
      
      - Reaching healthy number of use of VAO, and the number of users that are actively using it.
      
      - The appetite of the market for WEB3 solutions. Such in the case that the crypto market is growing with more adoption.
   
   - Transition to Phase 3 will be decided after confirming the stability of Phase 2 for some period of time with healthy growth in the number of active users.
