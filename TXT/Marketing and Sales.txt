- Total Addressable Market (TAM):
   - Is the globale market of everything that needs verifications of authenticity.

## Marketing and Sales Strategy

- Educational-Institutions First Strategy
   - First, target educational institutions:
      - Offer Ahket services to large educational institutions at no cost initially, relying on revenue from VFEEs.
      - Issued VACs can include academic degrees, transcripts, awards, recommendation letters, etc.
      - Tactic 1:
         - Engage with Resource Development Programs (RDPs) within educational institutions.
            - RDPs will advocate for Ahket within the institutions.
            - Motivated by the revenue generated from VFEEs to support their programs.
            - RDPs will become AHKETOs.
            - Collaborate with RDPs to:
               - Encourage graduating students to adopt Ahket and embed degree attestation in their resumes.
               - Connect with the Registration Office to convince them to adopt Ahket (if necessary).
                  - Registration Office can issue attestation of degrees and transcripts and become AHKETIs.
                  - If the institution uses CECredentials, a special attestation issuing service by Ahket can be used instead.
         - Engage with Student Engagement and Support Entities (SESE):
            - SESEs have direct communication with students.
            - Educate graduating students about Ahket and encourage them to use Ahket and become part of the Ahket ecosystem.
            - Students will become AHKETBs and embed Ahket in their job applications and LinkedIn profiles.
            - More students using Ahket in their applications leads to:
               - Increased returns to AHKETOs from VFEEs.
               - Increased visibility of Ahket to companies and institutions using VerifyAtOnce (VAO).
      - Tactic 2:
         - Reach out directly to students and motivate them by making them owners of the degree attestation.
         - Students can only earn points from verifications by other. It will be hard to redeem students in US Dollar (USD) for their points as this will require more legal, taxation, and SEC compliance requirements from Ahket Inc.
   - Second, target companies that have used Ahket for verification and became AHKETVs:
      - Reach out to these companies to convert them into AHKETIs and AHKETOs.
      - Offer them the opportunity to issue VACs for their employees' professional experience, achievements, training, certificates, etc.
